Review
"While living in the United States I patronized Starbucks. I even had a Starbucks card. It had a balance of around $25. I decided to travel overseas and walked into a Starbucks in Bangkok and presented my card for payment. It was not accepted!!! Starbucks cards are ONLY good in the country they are issued in! Imagine if American Express or Visa or Mastercard ran their business like that! As I can't return to the US because of the COVID pandemic, I essentially was scammed by Starbucks!"
"I purchased a Starbucks tumbler and used my Starbucks card. I put it away for summer drinks as 20 oz. of hot coffee would buzz me to bits. Last week, I went to Starbucks and had them put an iced coffee in there. This week, I made my own and I was drinking it and noticed that the cap didn't stay closed. I drank and the next thing I knew, I almost choked on a piece of plastic which fell into the tumbler. It scared the life out of me -- choking hazard -- who knew. I called Starbucks and they said the only way to return it was with a receipt (which I didn't keep since I used my Starbucks card). "
"Not one good review on this page. Doesn't surprise me. I called customer service before deciding to leave one myself. They didn't help. So here I am, leaving a review. NY customer service at Starbucks I guess is no different from the ones on this page from, Denver, NC, California, PA., GA, Canada, NJ, OH, KS, VA, TN, UT, SC, WA etc.! I'm sure the rest of the 50 States are here somewhere if I kept reading. Seems like Starbucks is not only on a roll for the worst customer service nationwide but for the decision to making customers wait even longer for a bagel or muffin that you don't even want toasted, or buttered, or for that matter baked! Which seems like what they might be doing for the length of time you are actually waiting for it. "
Good coffee choices although the coffee is better and cheaper at McDonald's or Dunkin. Good bagels. Food choices are not great but they'll do. Biggest plus: the staff are intelligent. Biggest minus: people (often young and healthy) hog seats without consuming food. And there are too few senior friendly seats (chairs with backs that are a normal height so that your feet can touch the floor).
"I have lived in my neighborhood for 15 years, and going to the local Starbucks on a weekly basis (that's a lot of money I've given them). The customer service had been pretty good during this time until the last few months. Most of the employees now working at the two Starbucks in my neighborhood are horrible, and don't seem to know a thing about good customer service. If you've ever done a Google search about customer service at Starbucks, you know what I'm talking about. There are numerous comments about how bad the customer service is, and I can definitely say that I agree 100%. "
"Unbelievable. Today I was so hungry with no time. I stopped by Starbucks on 145th st., wanted to grab something to take to eat before a very important meeting. They were out of all cakes except pumpkin bread, had NO BAG OF ANY KIND for me to put the sandwich I bought so they expected me to carry it in my HAND and to top it off gave me the wrong drink with a blank stare to go with it!!! Say what??? HORRIBLE."
"Starbucks on 3rd Avenue and 87th Street has a great Manager whose name is **. Every time I visited their store since its grand opening around 8 months ago the staff was friendly, dedicated, and efficient. They are busy like bees, and customer friendly ** and I exchanged pleasant words occasionally. On the afternoon of June 13th maybe ** had a day off so a young (18?) female Starbucks employee took it upon herself to deny entrance to the bathroom to a sickly middle age Caucasian woman who was bent over in agony while customers waited to see when she might urinate on the floor in front of the bathroom. I am a 74 year old Chairman and CEO of a Washington DC based International Consulting firm and after realizing that ** was off that day, I pressed the combination on the bathroom door so the woman could use the restroom because that's the way we treat human beings in America."
I always love how I always get great treated at Starbucks by Greenwich 14th street here in New York City! Those guys they work non-stop to serve us and I appreciate them and I love to tip for their hard work every time I go there...
"I go to Starbucks, 68th & 1st ave in NYC. In my opinion you must put the slowest workers in a very busy store. I have walked out more than once."
"I ordered a tall ice coffee and a cup of ice water, and they gave me a grande ice coffee and tried to charge me for it when I specifically told them that I wanted a tall. Another time the Starbucks employee gave me my change and told me not long after that she had given me too much change (that she had given ten cents extra) and when I gave it back to her she was no longer over the counter and instead of putting the money back into the drawer she just took it in her hand. Just yesterday I walked into a Starbucks to order my usual tall ice coffee and the employee gave me an attitude and spoke to me in a barely audible voice, and she looked visibly distressed that I was standing in front of her ordering a drink. "
"I went to my corner Starbucks at #7612, 1st Ave. & 60th street in NY. As usual, no smiles from the morning crew. But today, a particularly rude cashier by the name of ** had the nerve to interrupt my conversation with the person behind me when I told that person that this was the worst Starbucks in the neighborhood. He espoused very sarcastically how sorry he was and proceeded to talk back to me all the way through my transaction. The girl working behind him was using her cell phone while working, and the others were looking cross at every customer that walked in. Absolutely the worst customer service! This is sad. I have already complained to their management, but it seems that Starbucks has a monopoly here in NYC as they are literally on every corner!"
"Starbucks rarely has a bathroom available in New York City and the employees seem especially determined to resist any plea to give in.  Coffee is a diuretic and its cruel to make people hold themselves especially in New York where you're not allowed to use the bathroom in any public establishment without paying, so there's nowhere to go.  This guy was steaming the bathroom walls very slowly and I asked him if he would kindly please allow me a moment in between, I would even wait. He said no! "
"Two days in a row, I ordered spinach feta wraps. The first day, I got home and it only contained spinach and egg whites. Today, I received it and the worker checked it for me and said he saw some feta but no tomatoes. When I got home, there was enough feta for the first bite and a smudge of tomatoes on one side. I normally buy these in Paramus, NJ, and they are absolutely delicious. You can taste the feta most of the way through. Do individual stores prepare these or do they come ready-made. If they prepare them at the store, someone needs to review the portion control at this store. I just love the ones at Paramus."
Walked into buy a cup of coffee today and the guys working behind the counter were talking about herpes.  Normally I wouldn't care but it just seemed to be not the place or time to be talking about the subject.

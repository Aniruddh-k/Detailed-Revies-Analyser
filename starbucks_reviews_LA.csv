"I normally buy my Grande Pike at this Starbucks: 138 S Central Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90012. Today I decided to add bagel and cream cheese to complete my breakfast. I left and had to go back asap because the cream cheese given to me was an opened and used one. I asked for the Manager and she accommodated me but I had to say my piece to Chris who served me. I told him what was he even thinking about???? With all the plague all over the world why would you do that. He apologized but it never affected me because I don't know why he did that. Asked him why give me somebody else cream cheese??? What if it is contaminated. So how can I trust Starbucks now. Is that the training you have for your employees??? It is so Disgusting. I wish I could attach a picture of the  cream cheese. So consumers check what you buy all the time."
"Very bad customer service. The person who takes order does not smile and is rude. I asked if an over the counter sandwich can be heated and she rudely responded ""No"" with stern blunt voice, no apology whatsoever. I also asked another person working at the bar for water, he said ""one minute plz"" and then ignored me and started walking around the kitchen for 3 minutes or more. Finally, I went back to the order area to order water, the new barista was polite and addressed the request. Overall, very rude staff, worst staff ever seen at Starbucks. No outlets either. This experience has made me never go to a Starbucks again, ever! Specially after the horrific thing they were in the news for. I usually don't believe everything that they say in the news but given my own personal experience, I think this Starbucks at Cypress Park, Los Angeles, CA has racist staff."
"Starbucks retail locations in Hollywood, California regularly violate customer rights, illegally, unethically and they could care less. Hollywood area district manager Holm ** has instructed employees at all stores on Hollywood Blvd, Hollywood/Franklin, Hollywood/Vine, Hollywood/Western and others in the area, to deny paying customers' access to public restrooms, to refuse the cashing out of gift cards, and to overcharge customers by applying add-shot and alternative milk fees (like Soy or Coconut) when the fees are non applicable. Furthermore, when you contact the Starbucks customer service department via the 800# - easily the worst customer service team in the nation - they are trained to repeat: ""I'm sorry but a district manager will have to follow up with you."" The employees are rude, ignorant, and lack professionalism of any kind. If you request to speak with someone higher up, they'll laugh. "
"Today is 05/29/2016. I would like to make a complaint about the 5:00 Starbucks shift on this date at this time. I was cheated out of my change (money) on this day by one of the workers and I was told it is a policy by the manager or supervisor named ** that I am not able to get refill with lemonade inside of my tea at this particular location on 1258 South La Brea Ave; Los Angeles, CA 90019-1628, Telephone 323-934-2408 even though I paid the $0.50 fee. I am not a new customer and whoever these workers are that worked today on this shift is not good workers. The workers are currently not being supervised if they are dancing while at work and treating clients inappropriately. No refills? Saying that is not company policy seems like an lie. Every other Starbucks I go to allow refills. Thank you. Also restroom needs to be cleaned. There was urine all over the toilet. Thank you."
"I enjoy my coffee everyday. Unfortunately it has to be decaf latte. $3.00/day and with friends goes usually $20.00 bucks. I don't have problem with that, like I said. But I visited the store # 11233 in la 7/23/15 @ 4:47 pm. So, I was going to pay with $100.00 bill & the guy told me that he was not going to honor my money with no reason or apology. He just said no & he sent me to another store to change my bill. I had my kids with me. So I was unable to use my street language. I felt so bad. I can't believe how those people are trained. With no customer service skill @ all. I'm very confident that they lost my business. I have to visit another coffee shop from now on."
"We are in hard times as it is and a cup of Starbucks coffee is the most expensive coffee around. That said, I pulled up to a Starbucks drive thru and saw a tip jar hanging out the take out window and thought to myself, ""No way, I must be hallucinating"". I'm seeing way too many tip jars as it is everywhere I go and it sickens me. It's equal to a person saying,""hey if you don't tip me, you are not as cool as the people that do"". Look, I gladly tip at restaurants because it's a way to establish how one is to be treated. Plus, there are other people involved other than the waitress such as the bus boy, etc... "
"I'm a regular customer at Starbucks and I never knew that you had to buy a Cup of hot water for Tazo Tea which is a brand of Tea from Starbucks, I always buy it by the box! On 7/29/2014 about 1:30pm one of your Managers by the name of **, Store Manager @ 9718 Washington Blvd in Culver City, Ca 90232...Ph#310-204-1075. I told her that I had never heard of this policy and I offered to pay her for the hot water, then she said there wasn't any way that she could Charge me for the water, of course I became puzzled and asked her to please accept the money, even though I found this to be ridiculous and she went on to tell me ""Starbucks has always charged customers for cups and water whether you have our brand or not""!"
"This morning, I picked up the Sunday edition of the NY Times and paid a healthy $6.00 for it, only to discover that this freshly opened paper was missing sections. In the past, I had picked up the same paper and found 2-3 sections missing, and attributed it to someone rifling through it at the store prior to purchasing it. But this morning, the newspapers were still bound together and had not been read or touched by a prior reader. And again, the travel section and the book review section were missing - and those are my two favorite parts! Now I realize that the prior incidents were not done by someone else and instead, this local Starbucks receives and sells a partial paper for full price. Has anyone else encountered this?"
"I always like to get a coffee like around 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. It seems that every time I go to this Starbucks located at 3853 E. 3rd street Los Angeles, CA, they never have the cinnamon swirl coffee cake. I have been going to this Starbucks because it is closer to home and I have try to go a little earlier to see if maybe they just run out of this bread because it might be popular. But even that I always get no answer when I want to purchase this bread. This is not the first time that has happened to me! I am a manager of a fast food place and I know that customer service is really important as well as quality product. Hopefully, you guys can do something about this or I will have to stop going to Starbucks!"
My first day with the new gold card was so far not going well.  I feel that the letter I received did not fully explain how their system works! 
"This morning, like every other morning, I ordered a Venti Iced Coffee with EZ ice. The person doing the preparation added water to the coffee so it would be topped off with very little ice added. This seems very cheap on Starbucks' behalf. It's time to go to Peet's."
